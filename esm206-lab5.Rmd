## Part 1: Confidence Intervals

In this section we will use the 't.test()' function to calculate confidence intervals 

### Example 1

Create a single mock sample containing a number of values, then learn to use 't.test()' to return confiottedence intervals, and learn about in-line code referencing so our text becomes more reproducible too

```{r}
# Create a mock sample
otter_lengths <- c(30, 45, 28, 31, 34, 46, 52, 29, 90, 72, 112) # use t as sample size is too small, not Z distribution

# Find the confidence interval: 
otter_ci <- t.test(otter_lengths)

# Find the standard deviation:
otter_sd <- sd(otter_lengths)

```
here it means that if we took multiple samples of a population and calculated CI, we expect 95% of intervals to contain the population mean. Here, it could include the population mean or not. 

Mean otter length is 36.9 inches $\pm$ 9.3 (mean $\pm$sd, n=8) with a 95% confidence interval of [29.1, 44.7] inches. 

#### Now using in-line referencing 

Mean otter length is `r round(otter_ci$estimate, 1)` inches with a 95% confidence intervals of [`r round(otter_ci$conf.int[1],1)` `r round(otter_ci$conf.int[2], 1)`] inches

if it is a vector with multiple elements, we use[#]

## Part 2: Two sample T tests

Make two mock samples and ask the question do we have sufficient evidence to make us reject the null hypothesis that these samples were drawn from populations with the same mean?


### Example 1
```{r}
#Make my mock samples
oak_trees <- c(20, 19, 24, 28, 34, 12, 15, 25, 200, 180, 300)
  
pine_trees <- c(39, 26, 20, 30, 37, 22, 19, 18)

# Two-sample t-test
tree_t <- t.test(oak_trees, pine_trees) # two sided sample t test - it is only asking are they different enough in either directions for me to reject the null hypothesis

# Null hypothesis: mean heights are the same
# i.e.: Trees are drawn from populations with the same mean height
```

the mean heights of oak and pine trees were (X +- Y) and (X +- Y), respectively, and the difference was not significant (t(`r tree_t$parameter`) = `r tree_t$statistic`, p = `r tree_t$p.value`).

"two-sample t-test; t(df) = t-statistic, p = p-value"

*AVOID*: p = 0

when things get really small (usually p < 0.001)

*Not great:* p= 0.0000000013
*Better:* p < 0.001

## Part 3: Another t-test with cars data

Using the 'mpg' dataset

### Take a look at the data

```{r}
compact_suv <- mpg %>% 
  filter(class %in% c("compact", "suv"))

# Check for remaining levels 
unique(compact_suv$class) # returns the unique values that are exisitng in the file - only compact and suv groups of data are there 
```

Create a histogram of city gas mileage (cty) faceted by class starting from compact suv
```{r}
ggplot(data = compact_suv, aes(x= cty))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 12)+
  facet_wrap(~class)


ggplot(data = compact_suv, aes(sample = cty))+
  geom_qq()+
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

present more info about samples and not just t test results
Find some summary statistics for each group.
```{r}
car_stats <- compact_suv %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_city = round (mean(cty),2),
    sd_city = round (sd(cty), 2),
    sample_Size = n()
  )

car_stats
```

The t.test() function REALLY wants vectors of things.Use the 'pull()` function to pull out a vector from a dataframe (single column of values)

```{r}
compact_sample <- compact_suv %>% 
  filter(class== "compact") %>% 
  pull(cty)
```

# Your turn : do the same thing to get a vector of gas mileages for SUVs
```{r}
suv_sample <- compact_suv %>% 
  filter(class == "suv") %>% 
  pull(cty)
```

H0: Mean city gas mileages for SUVs and compact cars are the same
```{r}
t.test(compact_sample, suv_sample)
```
There is a significant difference in mean city gas mileage for SUVs and compact cars (t(df) = t-statistic, p < 0.001).


























## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
