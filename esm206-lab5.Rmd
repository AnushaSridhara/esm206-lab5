## Part 1: Confidence Intervals

In this section we will use the 't.test()' function to calculate confidence intervals 

### Example 1

Create a single mock sample containing a number of values, then learn to use 't.test()' to return confiottedence intervals, and learn about in-line code referencing so our text becomes more reproducible too

```{r}
# Create a mock sample
otter_lengths <- c(30, 45, 28, 31, 34, 46, 52, 29, 90, 72, 112) # use t as sample size is too small, not Z distribution

# Find the confidence interval: 
otter_ci <- t.test(otter_lengths)

# Find the standard deviation:
otter_sd <- sd(otter_lengths)

```
here it means that if we took multiple samples of a population and calculated CI, we expect 95% of intervals to contain the population mean. Here, it could include the population mean or not. 

Mean otter length is 36.9 inches $\pm$ 9.3 (mean $\pm$sd, n=8) with a 95% confidence interval of [29.1, 44.7] inches. 

#### Now using in-line referencing 

Mean otter length is `r round(otter_ci$estimate, 1)` inches.




```{r}

```













## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
